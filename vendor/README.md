Third Party libs
================

This isn't standard practice in Python land, but it's the best we can do on appengine.

These libraries should be as vanilla and close to upstream as is possible. The only exceptions are for any changes required for appengine compatibility (and these must be extensively documented below)

Vanilla Libraries:
  - django-appconf: https://github.com/jezdez/django-appconf
  - django-imagekit: https://github.com/matthewwithanm/django-imagekit
  - pilkit: https://github.com/matthewwithanm/pilkit
  - six: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/
