A massively multiplayer in-browser tower defence game.

This is a collaborative experiment to build a massively multiplayer tower defence game.  The goal here isn't to be ground breaking or earth shattering, but to have fun playing with some shiny APIs and building something just 'cause we can.

If you'd like to help then please get in touch @paddycarey on twitter.

All code will be licensed under the MIT license.  Assets and artwork will be licensed differently (to be decided later).

The backend will be built on Google Appengine with Django 1.5. Frontend stack to be determined.
